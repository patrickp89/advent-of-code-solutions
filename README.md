Some solutions to the annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles. :)

## How to build it?
Install [.NET 5.x](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
or higher, then simply execute:
```bash
$ dotnet build
```

## How to test it?
Download the input files form the AoC website and place them
in the `src/AoCSolutions.Test` folder. Then run:
```bash
$ dotnet test -l "console;verbosity=detailed"
```

> The input files are customized and yours will probably not
> yield the same results... :)
